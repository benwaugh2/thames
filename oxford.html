<h3>OXFORD</h3>

<p class="first">In about 1224 in Oxford, a Franciscan monk,
Salimbene, noticed that it was the Englishman's habit always to drain
off a beaker of wine saying <i>`ge bi a vu'</i> (`I drink to you'), thus
implying that it would be churlish for his friend not to drink as much
as he. Very convivial, but if, like me, you are sitting here
thoughtfully regarding Messrs Salters' boats just below the pub
garden, and have any idea of acquitting yourselves with any style,
think very carefully. I am.</p>

<p>By the end of of the eleventh century  the Franciscan Theobald of
Etampes, formerly Master at Caen, was giving instruction to between sixty
and a hundred students here, subscribing himself in letters <i>Magister
Oxenfordiae</i>. Oxford University was on its way. Then, in 1167, in the heat
of the dispute between Henry II and Thomas &agrave; Becket, English scholars were
recalled from Paris to arbitrate. They congregated at Oxford and its future
as a seat of learning was assured. The nucleus of the university centred on
St Mary's Church and Catte Street and around them sprouted up a supporting
community of bookbinders, illuminators and parchment-makers.</p>

<p>A university was originally a guild - a union formed by masters and
scholars to protect themselves from profiteering townspeople and  thus was
the line drawn between town and gown. In 1209, after an affray in which a
townswoman was killed (accidentally, the students insisted, aggrieved by
the fuss), citizens apprehended what students they could and hanged two, at
which point the rest - perhaps 3,000 `gowns' - scattered to Reading, Paris
and Cambridge, where Oxford's sister university was to grow. It is possible
that Oxford and Cambridge became great universities because in neither
place was there a bishop - hence there was freedom from ecclesiastical
supervision and a certain independence of thought was possible.</p>

<p>Or sometimes it was. John Wyclif (1330 - 84) became the first
Englishman to lecture on the Bible in about two hundred years. In his ire
(some fifty years later in 1428), Richard Fleming, Bishop of Lincoln, had
Wyclif's bones dug up and burned, the ashes being cast into the river. And
just to make sure, the next year he founded Lincoln College for students
preparing to equip themselves for the fight against unorthodoxy.</p>

<p><i>`It is a noble flourishing city, so possessed of all that can contribute to
make the residence of the scholars easy and comfortable, that no spot of
ground in England goes beyond it'</i>  wrote Defoe in <i>A Tour Through the Whole
Island of Great Britain</i>, but there are those who would disagree. Sir Thomas
More remembered his days at Oxford as days of cold and hunger, and later Dr
Johnson was to remember the <i>`sting of humiliation'</i> that his poverty
entailed.</p>

<p>Even earlier, there was the thirteenth-century St Richard of Wych, a
poor vegetarian who, because he shared a gown with a friend, could only
attend alternate lectures.</p>

<p>Walter Map thought that it was the <i>`rustics... who vie with each
other in bringing up their ignoble and degenerate offspring to the liberal
arts,'</i>  the aristocracy being <i>`too proud or too lazy to put their children
to learning'</i> and it was perhaps in response to his jibes that in 1474
Magdalen College was founded by William of Waynflete. Its aristocratic
cloister between chapel and river was expressly designed to make the sons
of fee-paying nobility feel comfortably at home.</p>

<p>But the sentiments of an early thirteenth-century letter home could
be those of any student in any age.</p>

<blockquote>This is to inform you that I am studying at Oxford with the
greatest diligence, but the matter of money stands greatly in       the way
of my promotion as it is now two months since I    spent the last of what
you sent me. The city is expensive and  makes many demands; I have to rent
lodgings, buy    necessaries, and provide for many other things which I
cannot      now specify. Wherefore I respectfully beg your paternity that
by the promptings of divine pity you may assist me, so that I       may be
able to complete what I have well begun...</blockquote>
