<h3>ST PAUL'S</h3>

<p class="first">Directly across the river from the Bankside Tate
annexe is a broad flight of steps, Peter's Hill, leading up to Sir
Christopher Wren's masterpiece, St Paul's Cathedral. Sung Eucharist
1700 at St Paul's does not mean 1700 AD, it means 17.00 hours, but if
I had realized that I would have missed it. The Choir of Christ Church
Cathedral, Indianapolis, is practising as I arrive.</p>

<p>Looking up at Wren's great dome you realize that you are actually
looking through it - or them. You are looking through a dome to a further
dome - from sphere to sphere. We nearly didn't have this dome. After the
Great Fire of London in 1666 rebuilding was forbidden until landowners had
cleared the roadway in front of their properties and established a legal
claim to the land. Which was very sensible when you come to think about it.
It also meant that there was time for a committee to be set up to consider
a rebuilding strategy.</p>

<p>St Paul's was in the process of rebuilding before the fire,
originally under the direction of Inigo Jones, but work had ceased during
the Civil War and by the time Wren's plans for completing the restoration
work were accepted, just six days before fire broke out, the nave was a
thoroughfare and the porch was a market-place where pedlars and
seamstresses traded and so did prostitutes. Pepys regularly picked up women
here.</p>

<p>But the plague was extinguished along with the fire, the slums had
been razed and here was a heaven-sent opportunity to plan a truly beautiful
city. John Evelyn submitted a plan on Italianate lines with trees, wide
streets, piazzas and a riverside quay reminiscent, perhaps, of Venice.
Christopher Wren envisaged turning the River Fleet into a canal and
building a scheme of streets radiating from the central point of a new St
Paul's Cathedral. Both wanted the city to be gracious, elegant and timeless
with noisy and smelly trades relocated on the outskirts. It was a nice
thought, but the consensus was that London was a commercial city and that
it should be business as usual.</p>

<p>The rebuilding of the cathedral, though, offered a clean slate for
Wren, with the opportunity for an entirely new design: English Baroque. His
first plan was rejected because - well, because churches had to be
cruciform and they had to have a steeple - but when his third design was
accepted Wren showed incredible acuity. Aware that, as building progressed,
economies would be insisted upon, he began building not in the usual way
from east to west, (which is why cathedrals take centuries to reach
completion), but to build upwards, stage by stage, from the ground. It was
a sensible precaution and building proceeded uninterruptedly. It took over
thirty years, but it didn't stop. Of course the authorities did insist on
economies - in fact, after twenty years they halved his salary - but Wren
was content.</p>

<p>He did not stick to the agreed plan. As work progressed he shortened
the nave and modified into circular form the meeting between nave and
transepts. Then, of course, a dome rather than a steeple was the only way
to crown it. And if any doubt remained in those fervent traditionalist
bosoms it was surely dispelled when he asked for a stone from the rubble to
mark the centre point of the dome. The stone he was handed read <i>`Resurgam'</i>:
I will rise again.</p>

<p>During the building of St Paul's, although he was engaged on the
building of probably fifty other churches, Wren visited the site at least
once a week to check on the progress. He lived across the Thames, at
Cardinal's Wharf, next to the reconstructed version of Shakespeare's Globe.
He was an old man by the time St Paul's was finished and his was one of the
first burials in the crypt. On the pavement under the dome is his epitaph:
<i>`Beneath lies buried the founder of this church and city Christopher Wren...
if you seek his monument, look around you.'</i></p>

<p>I had been expecting to hear William Byrd, and the Sanctus, by
William Albright, feels less like music than a - well, a sound. But what a
glorious sound! Rather like a great celestial rabble. The hymn they had
been practising when I arrived turns out to be called <i>`Tis good, Lord, to
be here!'</i> And I'm glad I came, too.</p>
