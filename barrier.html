<h3>THE THAMES BARRIER</h3>

<p class="first">East of the great Millennium Dome, between Wapping
New Stairs and King Henry's Stairs and near the entrance to the Blackwall
Tunnel is Execution Dock. Here, at low water, the hanging of pirates was
carried out, the bodies being left until three tides had washed over them.
This stretch of the river is called Bugsby's Reach and comparatively
recent (nineteenth-century) eyewitness accounts describe the sight of
bodies hanging in chains at `Bugsby's Hole', crows pecking at the flesh
through the metal netting in which they were encased. What kind of a mind
does it take to treat a fellow being like that?</p>

<p>Look ahead, though, at
those stainless steel sails straight from the Sydney Opera House. Look at
the elegant way they cowl the piers that step out across the river. What
kind of a mind did it take to envisage this? Each of these piers houses an
electro-hydraulic machine for turning the gates of the titanic Thames
Barrier and each gate has a counterbalance weighing in at 3,700 tons.</p>

<p>Once a month this monument to British engineering closes its gates just to
make sure all is in working order and once a year Londoners of all ages
converge in holiday mood when the barrier closes to confound an
exceptionally high autumn tide. Announcements of the procedure are made
over a loudspeaker system and those ashore of a mechanical inclination nod
sagely whilst pointing out the salient points to children and sweethearts
keen to be impressed. Engineering staff in hard hats gather in random
gangs atop the gantry and periodically disappear into a doorway and
descend to the depths of the river, there to be whisked secretly along its
silty bed. And up they come again at another towering island further
across the river. It is a great show; but it's not just a show, it is in
deadly earnest.</p>

<p>London has been prone to flooding from its very
beginning. In 1099 the <i>Anglo Saxon Chronicle</i> relates that <i>`On the festival
of St Martin, the sea flood sprung up to such a height and did so much
harm as no man remembered that it ever did before.'</i></p>

<p>Here at Woolwich in
1237 the marshes were described as <i>`a sea wherein many were drowned'</i>
and in the Great Hall at Westminster Palace that year the lawyers rowed around
in wherries. In 1242 the river overflowed at Lambeth to a width of six
miles, which would have included all the land up to and past Elephant and
Castle, including, perhaps ironically, Waterloo.</p>

<p>Flood water receding
from the Great Hall of Westminster Palace in 1579 left fishes gasping on
its floor. As recently as 1928 fourteen people were drowned in the
basements of Westminster, and only in 1953 a flood on the east coast and
the Thames Estuary claimed three hundred lives.</p>

<p>But it was not until the
full realization of what would happen if London's underground were flooded
that a decision was taken to augment the traditional river walls with a
barrier at Woolwich. (Such a fortification had been envisaged in the 1850s
by the philosopher and sociologist Herbert Spencer, rather ironically,
perhaps, considering that he was a great believer in the doctrine of
<i>laissez-faire</i>.)</p>

<p>Yet even this mighty Thames Barrier is a stop-gap measure.
Britain continues to tilt towards the south-east at a rate of one foot
every hundred years and the polar ice caps continue to melt. The tides,
therefore, continue to rise: presently at about the rate of two feet every
century. As we gather to admire the spectacle of these 65-foot high,
3,000-ton gates holding back the vast wall of water on the east side
while, on the west, canoeists frolic in the extemporised rapids of that
fraction that is allowed underneath the gates, we might pause to wonder
what the next step might be in the continual battle against the
encroaching sea.</p>

<p>But that there will be a next step we have no doubt. We
have modern science and technology at our beck and call and we just have
to set our minds to work.</p>

<p>What kind of a mind does it take? The human mind.</p>
