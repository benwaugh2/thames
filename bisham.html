<h3>BISHAM</h3>

<p class="first">Bisham Abbey now houses the Central Council of Physical
Education and is a centre of excellence for just about every sport you can
think of, from archery to weight lifting. It was built, though, in the
twelfth century as a preceptory, which is a subordinate community of the
Knights Templar. On dissolution of the Order by Philip IV (the Fair) of
France on pretty spurious charges of heresy, blasphemy etc. it became an
Augustinian Priory and then a Benedictine abbey. It is also the burial
place of the illustrious Nevilles.</p>

<p>In 1463 Richard Neville, Earl of Warwick (a.k.a. Warwick the Kingmaker)
staged a showpiece service here for the reburial of his father and his
brother, killed at Pontefract. It was designed, perhaps, as a challenge to
Edward IV, who had recently held a memorial service for <i>his</i> father and
brother, killed at Rutland.</p>

<p>Warwick's problem was perhaps basically
jealousy. He found it difficult to come to terms with the increasing
popularity of his tall and handsome cousin Edward when the hero's role had
for so long been his. The term `kingmaker' was applied to him because the
fortunes of his two kingly cousins: Henry VI of Lancaster and Edward IV of
York, waxed and waned according to his support. His last change of side
was to Henry in 1471, when he was killed during the Battle of Barnet. His
body was exposed for three days on pavement of St Paul's so there could be
no doubt about his death. Then he was buried in the Abbey of Bisham. After
his death the Nevilles lost some of their aura, because no one wants to be
associated with a loser.</p>

<p>Strangely, his two daughters were married into
both the Lancastrian and Yorkist families. Isabel married the Duke of
Clarence who, in Shakespeare's <i>Richard III</i> was drowned in the butt of
malmsey and Anne married Prince Edward, son of Henry VI. She is
Shakespeare's `Lady Anne'. 
Bisham Abbey became a country house for Anne
of Cleves on her divorce from Henry VIII, six months after her wedding at
age 23. Holbein, having been despatched to paint her, had done neither
Anne nor the king any favours with his depiction of an attractive and
graceful girl.</p>

<p><i>`I like her not,'</i> Henry announced on finally meeting her.
Anne had a <i>`gravity of face'</i> that displeased him. We never hear what she
thought when confronted with this grossly fat man, old before his time.
Henry (although of course it was Anne's fault) was unable to consummate
the marriage. He insisted that he doubted her virginity and was thus
disinclined to perform his marital duty. Anne took Henry's decision that
their marriage was `invalid' with equanimity and wrote to her brother the
Duke of Cleves begging him not to rock the boat - lest her fate be rather
worse than retirement to the state of `the king's well loved sister'.</p>

<p>Anne was always good to Elizabeth, who spent a lot of time here as a
child, and whom most people seem to have treated in a rather off-hand
manner - certainly when compared with her siblings Mary and Edward - and
she developed a taste for fleshly compensations. Supplies for her London
dwelling in 1556 are recorded as <i>`two hogsheads of beer of a ton each,
three hogsheads of Gascon wine, ten gallons of Malmsey wine, ten gallons
of sack...'</i></p>

<p>Elizabeth I had other friends here besides her stepmother
Anne. Bisham Church contains fine monuments to the Hoby family, who cared
for the king's sadly neglected second daughter. Sir Philip Hoby was
Henry's special envoy, despatched with Holbein on his next trip to ensure
he didn't exaggerate the attributes of the future marriage candidates.
Especially the tall and lovely Christina of Denmark, aged 16, recently
widowed by the Duke of Milan, whose portrait now hangs in the National
Portrait Gallery.  On being assured that the king was <i>`the gentlest of
gentlemen'</i> it is reported that Christina hid her face behind her fan,
which shook uncontrollably. Emerging with a very nearly straight face, she
replied demurely that if she had two necks the king should have one of
them.</p>
