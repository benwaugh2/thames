<h3>INGLESHAM</h3>

<p class="first">A flurry of tiny snowflakes wisped along the ice
leaves a delicate fan on the frozen lock water <i>en route</i> to
Inglesham. Unreal, monotone countryside, straight from a Rackham
illustration, with sepia-toned fields of dead corn, remote brown-brick
story-book houses and scribbled trees over ice-white fields. Until the
Church of St John the Baptist rises solidly from the riverside mist.</p>

<p>Thank God and William Morris for this beautiful church, saved by the
Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings from renovation in the
approved Victorian manner. The powerful nineteenth century Cambridge Camden
Society of `Ecclesiologists' saw as it as their function to ensure that
`the science of worship' was carried out appropriately in a building of the
type pleasing to God, a category strictly limited, apparently, to the
Gothic style of the fourteenth century, the Age of Faith. Which is why in
the booklet guides to local churches the words `restored in the 1880s' can
strike a chill into the heart.</p>

<p>In 1888 Morris and his Society took the Church of St John the Baptist
under their wing and insisted that its layers of history be preserved. Thus
survives this beautiful and silent testimony to the lives of centuries of
English people of divers descents. The church was given by King John to the
monks of Beaulieu in 1205, but even then it was over two hundred years old.
In the chancel, a stone carving of the madonna and infant revealed by the
hand of God could be from the time of Edward the Confessor and the ancient
Saxon preaching cross in the churchyard was surely the place from where
itinerant priests from a central mother church spoke to the local populace
before St John the Baptist of Inglesham was built  - certainly well before
the Norman Conquest.</p>

<p>Wandering across these frozen fields, with traces of medieval farming
visible in the furrowed landscape - it must be wonderful from the air - you
can see the appeal the Christian message must have had to these people,
beset by poverty, hard grind and, when the local lord so decided, the call
to war. Love, forgiveness and eternal rest would have been welcome news
indeed.</p>

<p>The interior, with its Jacobean boxed pews, remains much as it was in
the time of Cromwell's Commonwealth, but throughout are traces of continual
use - from the early thirteenth century the nave, arcades and ochre-coloured
wall paintings, still clear despite much over-painting in
following ages; from the fourteenth century the north door with its foliate
hinges; from the fifteenth the font; from the sixteenth the wooden pews
and screens; from the seventeenth the pulpit; from the eighteenth the
communion rails; and the Hanoverian Arms of the nineteenth century. The
twentieth century's contribution is no less important. It comes from the
Churches Conservation Trust who now care for this atmospheric and still
consecrated ancient building.</p>

<p>Inglesham was a flourishing village in the heyday of the medieval
Cotswold wool industry. In more recent times it was well placed for trade
with both London and Bristol during the brief flurry of activity on the
Thames and Severn Canal, so soon to be eclipsed by rail transport. The
canal joined the Thames at Inglesham Lock, which now comprises the garden
of the picturesque Round House on the north bank, the home of the last
Inglesham lock keeper.</p>

<p>The village is first mentioned in the year 950, and it probably means
<i>`the enclosure or river-meadow of a man called Ingen or Ingin'</i> but it may
have been named for King Ine, the `Law Giver' who, according to the <i>Anglo-Saxon
Chronicle</i>, built the Minster at Glastonbury and, having succeeded to
the Kingdom of Wessex in 688, held it for 37 years, despite engagement in
numerous local battles.  Or perhaps it was for Ingeld, his brother. The
brothers, according to the <i>Chronicle</i> in 855, could trace their ancestry
back through <i>`Noah, Lamech, Methuselah, Enoch, Jared, Mahaleel, Cainan,
Enos, Seth, Adam the first man who is Christ. Amen.'</i></p>

<p>Old? Well, you can't argue with that.</p>
