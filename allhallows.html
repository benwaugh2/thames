<h3>ALLHALLOWS</h3>

<p class="first">How to decide where the search ends?  Looking for the
Thames Estuary, one can keep going east seemingly forever and be
tempted to include more and more. Over there, on the northern bank,
past Southend, are Maplin Sands and Foulness island. Out here to our
right is the Isle of Grain and Sheerness and the Medway, and -
enough. Here on the south we are at Allhallows, noted mainly for a
caravan park, inexpensive seaside holidays for young London families
and a pub selling average beer and inordinately good sandwiches. And
this is the lowest reach of the Thames. Official.</p>

<p>But is it the end of the journey? After your average beer and
extraordinary sandwich, walk out over the two stiles and past the frisky
young bullocks.  Be nice to them - life is not going to offer them much,
despite their sweet faces and friendly dispositions. Today they seem to
have a game under way.  First, they all form a queue and follow any random
group of walkers until they reach the stile near the pub. Then they all
turn around and like cheeky children run hell-for-leather (although the
expression is an unfortunate one, given their future) towards the opposite
gate. Nothing seems to be driving them and nothing is happening there. They
stop, turn and tear off to the right. It is as if a rumour has gone round
that one of the gates is open, but no one is going to tell them which one
it is.</p>

<p>Far across the mudflats to the right, towards the Isle of Grain, a
tiny lighthouse denotes the beginning of the shipping channel. Further
inland, on the marshes, is a warning beacon. Across the dykes, rich Kentish
pasture land supports healthy looking cattle, sheep and horses and here, on
the marsh, numerous wooden piles in divers locations signify that the tiny
channel negotiable by <i>ad hoc</i> stepping stones has been at one - or various -
times used by boats.</p>

<p>Allhallows. Whilst Essex, across the Thames was obdurately pagan,
surely there has never been so Christian a county as Kent. <i>`Not Angles but
angels,'</i> murmured Pope Gregory, seeing fair-haired children for sale in
the Roman marketplace, and he despatched the reluctant St Augustine here to
the farthest outreach of the Roman church, where the influence of the Roman
occupation was fast disappearing, to gather the Anglo-Saxons into the
flock.</p>

<p>From Gaul, Augustine sent a last plea to Gregory to reconsider. He
was a Benedictine, not a missionary, and he didn't want to go to the edge
of the world. But Gregory stood firm, and the justification was the baptism
on Christmas Day 598 of ten thousand Kentish souls.</p>

<p>Now it is a haven for birds. Sandpipers, plover, redshanks and a
variety of other waders take off in high dudgeon as you walk over the
shelly sand. The marshes are worth a visit for their own sake. Take a day
out here, to walk and watch the oystercatcher and the dunlin going about
their daily work.</p>

<p>How many have walked here or sailed past this spot? Kings, emperors
and refugees; slaves, soldiers and princes; royal brides, Christian
missionaries and Vikings. An extraordinary variety of races and beliefs,
each making its unique contribution to what we fondly like to imagine the
`pure' English race.</p>

<p>Just stop for a while and listen: to the birds and to the past. Can
you hear the faint chanting of plainsong? The plash of galley oars? Can you
sense the presence of St Augustine?  Of Hengist and Horsa, leading the
first Anglo Saxons?  Of Harold Godwinson? William the Bastard?  Pip and
Magwich? Little of a concrete nature remains here to tell us of the people
who journeyed through the centuries where we journey today, but just
listen.</p>

<p>And what has it all been about, the search?  In the silence of the
marshes you could be tempted to think, just for an instant, that you <i>almost</i>
understand... and then, in another instant, it is gone. But surely it is
still there. Just listen.</p>
