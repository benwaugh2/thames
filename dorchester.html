<h3>DORCHESTER</h3>

<p class="first">In late October, at Chesters Coffee Shop in
Dorchester, wedding guests are all of a hoo-hah over their
lunch. Probably too excited even to appreciate what extremely fine
home cooking they are being offered. If you were ever to be suddenly
overcome with longing for a slice of mince pie with apricot with
lashings of clotted cream I would recommend a trip to
Dorchester-on-Thames.</p>

<p>What a wonderful place to get married! This village is pure picture-book,
or you would think so if it were not for its extraordinary history.
Each of the old pubs is picturesque and friendly. The bridesmaids waiting,
chilled, in the churchyard, are dressed in mulberry and cream, almost too
perfectly synchronizing with the autumnal leaves on the shrubs and the
rosehips amongst the ancient yews and tumbling gravestones. The glorious
abbey building (mainly fourteenth century - from the time of Edward II)
sports a chequer-board pattern of flint and stone on octagonal pillars at
the corners of the massive turreted tower.</p>

<p>Late at night, the door to the abbey is mysteriously left unlocked.
Inside, a single light in the chancel burns, barely enough to illuminate
the beautiful stone tracery of the famous Jesse window, doubling as the
branches of the genealogical tree which details the descent of Jesus from
Jesse, father of David.</p>

<p>Here is also an unusual memorial to a crusader: the curved effigy of
Sir John Holcombe, knighted on the field of battle, who died of wounds
received in the Holy Land. This may explain the curious position of the
effigy - the body twisted around as if he wanted to reach something just...
over... there.</p>

<p>The monks of Dorchester were famous for their beer. I try to explain
the quality of the silence to a local in the pub over a pint of the local.
He says: `I have felt that - and the deathly cold. The time I saw the monk
disappear behind the pulpit, where the tunnel begins.'</p>

<p>I am not fortunate enough to see the ghost of the monk, nor indeed
unfortunate enough to feel the deathly cold. Instead, there is a silence so
beautiful and so profound that I am loath to leave. Emanating from the
bouquets of lilies left from the wedding earlier in the day a faint scent
of spice - like nutmeg? - permeates the stone.</p>

<p>Dorchester is perhaps most famous for a baptism. St Birinus was a
missionary bishop, probably of Germanic birth, sent from Rome to preach in
the `inner parts' of England, but when he found that the people of Wessex
were still heathen he decided to stay and work there. He baptized King
Cynegils in the river here at Dorchester in 635 and here, too, is where he
set up his see.</p>

<p>The year after the baptism of Cynegils Birinus also baptized the
king's son, Cwichelm. Cynegils and Cwichelm seem to have been a formidable
combination. They fought the great Mercian king Penda  (575 - 655) at
Cirencester in 628 and, as the <i>Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</i> reports, <i>`then came to
an agreement'</i>.  Anyone who came to an agreement with the warlike Penda is
worthy of respect, but as far as Penda was concerned, they chose their
friends badly.</p>

<p>For their respective baptisms both Cynegils and Cwichelm had as
sponsor the Northumbrian king Oswald, whose daughter Cynegils married, and
no friend of Oswald was a friend of Penda. Penda spent a large part of his
time fighting Northumbrians and, it must have seemed, an increasingly large
part fighting newly converted Christians. He never converted himself, but
his son, Peada, was baptized when he married the daughter of the Northumbrian
king Oswiu, and even before his father's death he had begun arranging
for the conversion of the Midlands.</p>

<p>In 636, the year after his baptism, Cwichelm died and perhaps it is
he remembered on the Sinodun Hills on the `Poem Tree'.</p>

<blockquote>
      That ancient earthwork form'd old Murcias bounds<br>
      In misty distance see the barrow heave<br>
      There lies forgotten lonely Culchelm's grave.</blockquote>
