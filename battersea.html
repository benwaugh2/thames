<h3>BATTERSEA</h3>

<p class="first">In World's End, on a small island across the river,
just near the outlet of warm water from Lots Road power station, are
no fewer than ten herons. It's probably a kind of heron spa. The
youngsters engaged in learning kayak skills in the rapids will
probably not be too concerned if they are tipped out, either.</p>

<p>The present Battersea Bridge was designed by Sir Joseph Bazalgette
and completed by 1890 and I pause for thought on my way across. In the
1890s the new craze was bicycling. The first bike might be said to be the
<i>célérifère</i>, built by the Comte de Sivrac in 1791. It consisted of two
wheels joined by a bar with a wooden seat, astride which you sat and
`walked' the bike along. But it was a start. The hobby horse, velocipede
and penny farthing followed in quick succession until 1874 when H.J. Lawson
produced the first chain-driven machine. The design has hardly changed
since and I can state categorically that there has never - <i>ever</i> - been a
more logical, efficient and affordable form of transport.</p>

<p>By 1896 bicycles were banned from Hyde Park and Battersea Park,
within easy reach, was well used by cyclists. In fact it was packed with
them. Those who were too nervous to participate were almost  content just
to watch. They probably felt a bit like I do when watching people
surfing... but then I put the thought firmly back in the Too Difficult Box
and get back on my bike.</p>

<p>Once upon a time - about twenty years ago - the ugliest pub in
Christendom was on the Battersea waterfront, not far from where the once
again highly fashionable Battersea Village has rematerialized. There was
also, I seem to remember, a harmless eccentric living on a ramshackle
barge. There were Plans for the area though, and mysteriously, one night,
the barge was burned out and the inhabitant disappeared. Now, from the
terrace of  smart houses comes the clink of glasses and snatches of
sophisticated conversation.</p>

<p>The area is very desirable now. No hermits, no eccentrics. The up-market
flats on the riverfront are in buildings named to reflect the
river's trading history: Molasses House, Calico House, Ivory House,
Plantation Wharf... and yes, it is very attractive.</p>

<p>For a little while in the 1990s there was an eco-village here, named
Land and Freedom. It housed a group of young squatters proclaiming their
right to trespass. They were not freeloaders, but idealists. Leo, recycling
bits of old bikes to make new ones, told me: `Anyone can come here as long
as they contribute. If you just want to sit around and drink beer you're
not welcome.'  Tiny gardens were scratched out of land and surrounded with
stones with irrigation systems made from old drainpipes and plastic
bottles. Notices abounded: <i>Homes for Heroes... People not Profit...
Make the Wasteland Grow...</i> They planted vegetables to grow on a rotation
system, but of course they never really had time for a rotation system to
get going.</p>

<p>Battersea has always had particularly fertile soil. At the time of
the Norman Conquest `Badric's Island' was a thriving Saxon settlement and
St Mary's of Battersea was here, even then; the ancient building, however,
was replaced in 1777 by the present simple village church, in time for
William Blake to marry the daughter of a local market gardener in 1782.
Catherine Boucher was talented but illiterate - she signed the marriage
register with an `x' - and she worshipped Blake. Their domestic cleansing
arrangements were not a priority. Catherine insisted: <i>`But Mr Blake don't
dirt!'</i></p>

<p>Nearby is where the River Wandle meets the Thames. The creek at
present is a feeding and over-wintering ground for a variety of birds:
kingfishers, pintail ducks, sandpipers, redshanks, wagtails - but their
arrangements may have to change if the gleam in the developers' eye for an
upmarket marina is to come about.</p>

<p>Sainsbury and Safeway, twin monuments to our culture, confront each
other across the water and I wonder what the author of `Jerusalem'  would
have made of it all.</p>
