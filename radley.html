<h3>RADLEY AND NUNEHAM</h3>

<p class="first">`You have a lot of work to do,' smiles the plump, elderly lady
sitting beside the slipway at Radley. I'm never all that gracious when
people throw this line at me, in total ignorance as to how much work I
have done. `We may not be able to buy your book if it's too expensive,'
she simpers. `But we'll order it from the library.'</p>

<p>I'm no more gracious to people whose support is carefully cool and
whose inevitable criticisms come from a depth of self seldom fathomed in
kindness. `Why don't you go jump in the river,' I say sweetly and shove
her in. Oh, the power of the imagination.</p>

<p>From Iffley to Abingdon is not a long distance, but it is a hard
one along a track too bumpy to cycle comfortably. Across the river is the
stately bulk of Nuneham Park, manor house of Nuneham Courtenay. The
Nuneham means `new village' and the Courtenay comes from the Curtenay
Family, who lived here in the thirteenth century. It has been new any
number of times. In the <i>Domesday Book</i> it is listed as `Newham' and as
recently as 1760 the whole village was rebuilt in nice modern
semi-detached cottages because the existing houses spoiled the view from
the First Earl of Harcourt's new house.</p>

<p>But, a very fine house it is, with landscaping by Capability
Brown. Queen Victoria and Prince Albert spent their honeymoon here,
according to the couple taking the balmy evening air outside Radley
College's impressive modern boathouse. They remember the late Earl cycling
down the hill to Radley railway station every morning, on his way into
London to work in the city.</p>

<p>The estate now belongs to Oxford University and on the skyline is
visible an elaborate monument dating from 1616. The Carfax Conduit was the
cistern in the middle of Oxford from which the city's water was drawn: a
primary cistern for university folk and a secondary one for the
townspeople. A monument to the past indeed.</p>

<p>Why do we grow so much oilseed rape?  With a such a wealth of
sweetness, brilliance and delicacy to choose from - here in the bright red
mini-globes of wild arum, the palest-pink florets of yarrow, the exquisite
coral-and-lime sprays of water dock, the regal purples of thistles and
knapweeds and the tiny yellow snapdragons of toadflax; with the plethora
of blue speedwell, white archangel, wild marjoram, water mint, comfrey,
forget-me-not, pimpernels, poppies, balsams and loosestrife; with rosebay
willowherb, enchanter's nightshade, musk mallow and sun spurge, dovesfoot
cranesbill, strawberry clover and meadowsweet; all with their specific hue
or scent or form, not to mention the beauty of the names - why, oh why do
we suddenly have all these fields of the unspeakable rape? The
overwhelming smell in spring of the garish yellow flowers, then the reek
of the seed pods... Yet even as I write synchronicity is at work. Rape is
out and linseed in, for commercial rather than aesthetic reasons, but one
day soon, perhaps, this sea of acid yellow will be a haze of subtlest
blue.</p>

<p>The hour is late when we reach Abingdon. Back to Oxford by road,
we decide. The A4183 looks suitably cycle-friendly, and so it proves until
we have to cross the A34 and temporarily lose our bearings. A couple with
a tandem wait to cross from the Oxford side and rather than meet halfway
across the slipway, up which the cars speed ceaselessly, we wait on the
comparative haven of the traffic island to ask directions. The woman is
delighted to help. Her voice, though, is barely intelligible to us.
Haltingly, using a minimum of words but a maximum of smiles, it is left to
her gentle, kindly and cultured white-haired companion to interpret while
she nods emphatically. A companionship of mutual respect and affection.</p>

<p>`A battleground,' he says, gesturing to the traffic beating up
from the trunk road. We all four stand and look for a minute at the combat
zone and beyond, to where the great orb of the setting sun spins, huge and
silent and ruby red. Along the A34 and past us up the slip road the
mechanized army hurtles headlong into endless battle, heedless.</p>
