<h3>THE SOURCE</h3>

<p class="first">About a quarter of a mile across the fields from the
King's Head pub on the A433 outside Kemble, a simple monument beneath
an ash tree bears the inscription:</p>

<p align=center>THE CONSERVATION OF THE RIVER THAMES<br>
            1857-1974<br>
            THIS STONE WAS PLACED HERE TO MARK THE<br>
            SOURCE OF THE RIVER THAMES</p>

<p class="cont">Ten feet in front, a small basin of stones in the
ground may, if you are very lucky, be submerged in clear water. If you
look closer you will see sporadic bursts of tiny bubbles making their
way to the surface; gently, so that, if you did not know, you might
think they were raindrops.  This is, indeed, the source of the river
up which the Romans sailed at about the time Christ was born, on
which, in 1536, Anne Boleyn took her final tragic journey and for
which Handel in 1717 composed the sublime <i>Water Music</i> for a homesick
German king. The river on which, during Victoria's reign, three men in
a boat undertook an hilariously memorable holiday and on which Ratty
and Mole will adventure forever, just messing about in boats.</p>

<p>From here until it reaches Oxford, the Thames is called the Isis,
after the Egyptian fertility goddess, sister and consort of Osiris, god of
the underworld and judge of the dead. Jung saw Isis as <i>anima</i>, the feminine
principle present in the male unconscious:  guide and mediator to the inner
world.</p>

<p>Here is quiet.  From the thicket of blackberries and briar beyond you
may hear the bubbling of wood pigeons, or a lone song thrush may burst the
silence.  If you have made your way here from the Pool of London or from
the Thames Barrier it could seem that it would take but a small leap of
faith to follow Isis into a higher, more spiritual world.</p>

<p>Again, if the season has been abundant in rain, you may look south-eastwards
from the tablet and see a series of shallow pools receding into
the distance. Follow them, and stop occasionally to look closely.  Here and
there the tell-tale bubbles will surface and at some point you will notice
that the shallow water is moving; flowing forward with a sense of purpose,
and you can almost begin to believe that you are at the beginning of a
secret that will in time become apparent as the most historic river in the
world.</p>

<p>In winter, after snow, to believe that this is the source of a great
river requires a larger leap. Crows cronk and caw derisively from the frost-laden
thicket behind. Huge bulls lounge in the snow disregarding one
perhaps just a little too carefully, and the apparently seamless fields
stretch far and white down to the Fosse Way, or the A433 as it is more
likely to be known today.</p>

<p>The Fosse Way is the road the Romans built between Lincoln (<i>Lindum</i>)
and Bath (<i>Aquae Sulis</i>), just part of the 6,000 or more miles they built:
straight, no-nonsense highways,  many still serving today. A fosse is a
ditch, and the Fosse Way was so named because of the deep trench either
side which it has still. Along to the left, before the road to Ewen, you
will have to clamber over it to read a plaque in a little stone bridge
almost obscured in autumn by probably the best blackberries in the world.
This is the old Thames Head Bridge of 1789, which realignment of the road
in 1962 rendered redundant. Below ran the visionary Thames and Severn
Canal, which effectively converted mainland Britain into two islands, long
disused and now dry.</p>

<p>The Thames, however, as land form dictates, soon contracts itself
into a deeper, swifter channel where river crowfoot spreads out its mermaid
tresses.  Its artless white flowers will caress the surface of the water in
spring as its less aquatically inclined cousin, the tiny, yellow-flowered,
celery-leafed crowfoot, shyly hugs the bank of what is clearly a river with
ambition.</p>
