<h3>RICHMOND</h3>

<p class="first">Richmond is an interesting mixture of the majestic
and the bijou; of the ancient and the new. Or newish. It has a fine
little museum on the second floor of the old town hall where, as I
peruse the model of Richmond Palace, as rebuilt in 1509 by Henry VII,
I am suddenly blasted by `Roll Over Beethoven.'  There is a temporary
exhibition at present of the Rock 'n' Roll Years. It makes it hard to
concentrate and as I leave and the voluntary custodian hopes I enjoyed
my visit I am torn between honesty and politeness. Honesty wins.</p>

<p>`I wish you had said,' she tells me, `I could have turned it down.'
But what was there to say? It would be unreasonable for me to expect
everyone to share my taste for silence and it's not that I'm not a bit of
an old rocker myself. `Do tell your friends when they visit to ask to have
it turned down,' she says. So I'm telling you now.</p>

<p>The model is a good one, though. It shows the palace built by Henry
VII to replace the manor of Shene destroyed by fire at  Christmas, 1497.
And even that was not the original Shene Manor. Before that stood the manor
where Edward III died, deserted even by his servants who, led by his
mistress Alice Perrers, had snatched the rings off his fingers. Edward's
grandson, Richard II and his wife, Anne of Bohemia, used Shene as their
favourite summer residence and it is recorded that each day they fed ten
thousand guests, which hardly seems possible. But she was an extraordinary
woman and much beloved of Richard, which is conveniently forgotten when
people talk about his sexuality. He destroyed Shene after she died of the
plague here in 1394. In the Undercroft Museum of Westminster Abbey there is
a painted wooden funeral effigy of her, showing a very serious, perhaps
rather sad looking woman with a long face and a rather endearing double
chin.</p>

<p>Before he set out for Harfleur and Agincourt, Henry V founded two
religious communities near Sheen. One was a Carthusian monastery on the
site of the Old Deer Park, and the other was Sion monastery for the
Bridgettine order of monks, nuns and lay brothers. In the centuries
following the Dissolution, Shene's priory buildings became dilapidated and
in the eighteenth century George III demolished those remaining to use the
area as pasturage. The hamlet of West Shene was also demolished and now
Shene is remembered only in the names of North and East Sheen and Sheen
Common.</p>

<p>But back to Henry VII. Having rebuilt it, the king was so enamoured
of his brainchild that he renamed it his `Manoyr of Richmount'  or
sometimes `Rychemonde' after his earldom of Richmond in Yorkshire. In fact,
though, it was now a royal palace. His sons, Princes Arthur and Henry
(later Henry VIII), were brought up here, where the court was famed for its
culture and the surrounding country (Richmond Park) for hunting. Henry VII
preferred this to all other royal residences and when he died here in 1509
it was rumoured that he left hoards of gold hidden all over the palace.
Quite possibly - he was a notorious miser. You can still see parts of the
palace: the gate still survives in Old Palace Yard as does the wardrobe,
now used as private housing.</p>

<p>There are numerous attractive buildings in Richmond. Also on the
green of Old Palace Yard with an imposing facade towards the river is
Trumpeter's House, built in the early seventeenth century, probably by John
Yemans, successor to Christopher Wren as Surveyor of Works. Metternich
lived there in 1849 when Disraeli described it to his sister as <i>`the most
charming house in the world'</i>. Also admired (though not by me) is Asgill
House, in `honey-coloured stone', also facing the river and also on the
site of the old palace. It was built in 1758 by Sir Robert Taylor for the
banker Sir Charles Asgill.</p>

<p>Architectural purists describe Quinlan Terry's Richmond Riverside
complex of offices, shops, restaurants and flats as pastiche whereas Prince
Charles reckons it <i>`an expression of harmony and proportion'</i> and I would
have to agree with both. That is pure Richmond.</p>
