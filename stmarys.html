<h3>ST MARY AT LAMBETH</h3>

<p class="first">It is hard to imagine today's contained, urban Thames
as the sprawling giant it once was, but it was possible, some thousand
years ago, to ford the Thames at this point and in 1088 Lambeth was
called Lamhytha, the `landing place for lambs'.</p>

<p>Within the Church of St Mary at Lambeth is a fine modern (Francis
Stevens, 1950s) stained-glass window depicting five saints with special
relevance to the church. One is St Christopher who is traditionally shown
carrying a traveller on his back across a river. Perhaps even this one.
Another of the saints is Edward the Confessor, and his connection with St
Mary's is a personal one. While Edward was building his great  abbey across
the way on the Isle of Thorney, his younger sister Goda, Countess of
Boulogne, was building a church here. I like to imagine them rowing across
to compare building notes. Well, it was possible.</p>

<p>St Mary at Lambeth is now home to the Tradescant Museum of Garden History, the
churchyard containing a delightful walled `knot' garden where many of the
plants collected by John Tradescant, father and son, thrive. The museum is
one of the most rewarding in the capital - small and friendly with
attractive shop and cafe. Mozart's first `Susannah', Nancy Storace was
buried here, as were Captain and Mrs Bligh and the Tradescants. Nancy has a
plaque inside, funded by her mother, and the Blighs and Tradescants have
impressive tombs in the garden.</p>

<p>It was largely thanks to the two Tradescants that English gardens
became more than the traditional repositories for herbs with medicinal and
culinary uses or for cosmetics and dyes. When the Wars of the Roses came to
an end with the death of Richard III on Bosworth Field, the era of the
Tudor peace began, when gracious living became the norm and the traditional
castles gave way to country houses. It was then that gardeners like the
Tradescants came into their own, bringing in from France and the
Netherlands, and later from Constantinople, exotic plants such as  tulips,
anemones, lilies, cyclamen and hyacinths. They also experimented with
cross-breeding from seeds, giving rise to new species such as carnations.</p>

<p>John Tradescant the elder, employed by Robert Cecil, was sent abroad
by his employer to buy plants for his house, Hatfield. From the low
countries he sent back such exotic varieties as vines, cherries, quinces,
medlars, mulberries, pears and currants - sensibly keeping aside duplicate
specimens for his own use. He then travelled on to Russia, from whence he
<i>almost</i> brought back such novelties as hellebores, muscovy rose and dwarf
dogwood, but on such a long journey his luck ran out. The plants were
watered by the crew with salt water and the berries, a natural remedy for
scurvy, were eaten. He did, however, keep a detailed diary of his journey
and discoveries, held now in the Bodleian Library in Oxford. From Virginia
the younger John brought back numerous varieties of plants, including the
now hugely popular Virginia creeper.</p>

<p>The Tradescants were men of many parts. The elder John undertook a
voyage to Algiers to confront the notorious Barbary pirates and he was part
of the Duke of Buckingham's entourage which travelled to fetch the French
princess Henrietta Maria as a bride for Charles I. Perhaps it was John
Tradescant who first named her <i>`the Rose and Lilly Queen'</i>, amalgamating the
English rose with the Fleur de Lys.</p>

<p>The Tradescants had their own museum in Lambeth, which they called
the `Ark of Novelties', but by fair means or foul (the latter is the most
popular theory) their collection was commandeered by  Elias Ashmole after
the death of John Tradescant the younger, to form the basis of the
Ashmolean Museum in Oxford.</p>
