<h3>CLIFFE AND COOLING</h3>

<p class="first">In 851, when Alfred the Great was about three
years old, 350 Viking ships sailed up the Thames to invade London. In 855
they set up camp on the Isle of Sheppey and in 865 the Kentish peninsular
was overrun and the promise of Danegeld extracted from the men of Kent.  
Alfred never really got the hang of treating the Vikings as the hooligans
they were rather than fellow Christians. He thought he had been proved
right when his enemy Guthrum was baptised in 878, after the Battle of
Edington, but he wasn't. After Alfred's death the raids continued as ever,
which is why Edward the Elder (Alfred's son) paid 40 pounds of gold by way
of ransom for a bishop in 914.</p>

<p>The delicate stone tracery aound the tower
of Cooling Castle dates from 1381, at a time when raids from Europe were
the threat. Just in 1380 a combined Spanish and French fleet had entered
the Thames and burned and looted both Tilbury and Gravesend.  Cooling
Castle belonged to Sir John Oldcastle, Shakespeare's Falstaff. In the
earliest version of Henry IV Falstaff is actually called Sir John
Oldcastle, but the Cobham family objected; perhaps not surprisingly when
you consider how far Shakespeare's greatest comic character strays from
his original. Sir John Oldcastle (Lord Cobham thanks to his marriage) was
certainly the one-time friend of King Henry V, but fell out of favour in
1413, shortly after his accession, by leading an ill-fated Lollard
uprising. Rather than meeting the peaceful death Falstaff comes to after a
life of drunken debauchery, Sir John was declared a heretic in 1414 and
confined to the Tower, from which he escaped only to be captured near
Welshpool and <i>`hung and burnt hanging'</i> for his religious zeal. Not much
like Falstaff at all when you come to think of it.</p>

<p>In the churchyard of St James on Cooling Marshes are the</p>

<blockquote>little stone lozenges, each about a foot
and a half long, which were arranged in a neat row ... and were sacred
to the memory of five little brothers of mine - who gave up trying to get
a living exceedingly early in that universal struggle</blockquote>

<p class="cont">and to which Pip was</p>

<blockquote>indebted for a belief I religiously entertained that they had all
been born on their backs with their hands in their trouser pockets, and
had never taken them out in this state of existence.</blockquote>

<p class="cont">This is the
churchyard where Pip pondered on life and death and these marshes
<i>`intersected with dykes and mounds and gates, with scattered cattle
feeding on it ... the low leaden line beyond [that] 
was the river...'</i>
were where our small, terrified hero from <i>Great Expectations</i> first
encountered the escaped convict. This is pure Dickens country. But it is
more than that.</p>

<p>If you head north from the church of St Mary at Higham and
wander amongst the disused and flooded chalk quarries you may, with a
little luck or an excellent map, come to Cliffe Fort, one of a ring of
five built in the nineteenth century to frustrate Frankish ambitions. You
may equally well, as I do, get lost and spend a good hour or so following
lines of bullrushes, looking for the way across a network of drainage
ditches and heaving your bike across ten-foot high gates. But pause a
moment and reflect.</p>

<p>Have you ever before seen ships sailing apparently
through marshlands with such ease? Have you ever seen a sky so vast, so
evocative, so perfectly Dutch? This is pure Cuyp, pure Wouwerman.  And
when, finally, you mount the earthen seawall and find Cliffe Fort
crumbling back to the earth, have you ever seen such perfection of colour
and lack of colour? Have you ever seen such a silver as this, shafting the
cloud to light the estuary? Have you ever seen such blacks as in this
seaweed, as in these seeds of sea-hog fennel, as in those elderberries
swooping through wine-red rosehips?  And here in the mud is the blackening
wreck of an old Finnish schooner which, <i>en route</i> from Sheerness in the
1960s, got this far and simply gave up the ghost; an atonement, perhaps,
for the years of pillage? And see where those five jet-black cormorants
stand in line, motionless, on the ruined jetty. They could almost be the
shades of Mary's nuns, watching for Matilda's army.</p>
