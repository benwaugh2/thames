<h3>HAMPTON COURT</h3>

<p class="first">The building of the palace of Hampton Court, just 14
miles from Westminster, was begun in 1515 by Cardinal Wolsey. Wolsey had
bought the site from the Order of St John of Jerusalem the year before he
became Cardinal and Lord Chancellor of England. With 280 rooms for guests
and a staff of over five hundred, the hospitality offered by Wolsey was
the wonder of Europe and Henry VIII so envied its splendid architecture
and fittings that Wolsey made it over to him in 1526. But the gift was not
enough to save him from execution in 1530.</p>

<p>Henry was a keen gardener and
a huntsman and he took a personal interest in laying out the gardens and
stocking the park with game. Hampton Court was where his beloved third
wife, Jane Seymour died, having given birth to Edward IV, and where Edward
spent most of his short existence, the clean air and the pure water
perhaps extending his life a little. His sister Mary received her proposal
of marriage here from the awful Philip II of Spain and after her marriage
returned through these gates to spend most of her honeymoon and the four
lonely years of her reign here, waiting in vain through false pregnancies
and bitter recriminations for the baby that never came.</p>

<p>Elizabeth came to
live here the year after her accession to the throne in 1559. She, too,
was a keen gardener, enjoying the nitty-gritty of digging and planting -
but only when unobserved. In company, <i>`She, who was the very image of
majesty and magnificence, went slowly and marched with leisure.'</i> One is
reminded of a description by a contemporary at Windsor Castle who remarked
on the Queen's perambulations on the battlements - but only in calm
weather. She had a detestation of wind, probably as well as ruffling the
royal composure it unsettled the royal wig.</p>

<p>Charles I dug the wide
channel, 11 miles long, for bringing water to the ornamental lakes and
fountains he designed in the gardens, and brought some four hundred fine
paintings (including nine Mantegnas) as well as sculptures, ivories,
crystal and porcelain to adorn the living quarters.</p>

<p>Here is some of
finest Tudor architecture in Britain and, sadly, for its preservation we
have to thank the untimely death of Queen Mary of smallpox in 1694. Mary's
marriage to William, Prince of Orange, was a political one: Charles II
having no legitimate children meant that her father, James Duke of York
was the heir to the throne, and after him came Mary, the eldest of his two
daughters. The religion of James was suspect, however: although he was not
overtly Catholic, it was widely known that it was with Rome that his heart
belonged. So, with the paranoia and terrorism associated with the
so-called Popish Plot, it was expedient that the pretty fifteen-year-old
Princess Mary should be allied with the state of Orange, perceived as a
brave anchor of Protestantism in Europe. Never mind that her cousin, her
appointed bridegroom, was ten years older, physically weak with a tendency
to a hunchback and taciturn to a degree - not unlike his
great-grandfather, William the Silent. Yet William and Mary were happy
together and in 1688, a bloodless coup was executed when they landed in
England and, James II having fled abroad for his life, were jointly
offered the throne.</p>

<p>William and Mary reigned in tandem for only six years,
and during their tenure of Hampton Court Henry VIII's state departments
were demolished, it being the intention of their chosen architect, Sir
Christopher Wren to built a new Versailles. Between 1696 and 1704 Wren was
busy rebuilding and extending the palace, with constant advice and
encouragement from Mary, whose judgement and taste Wren termed
`exquisite'. Well, it would be, with her Stuart ancestry. But the point is
that after her death William lost heart somewhat and the plans for the
great new palace were somewhat curtailed.</p>

<p>Which is nice for us, because
from different fa&ccedil;ades we have two very different palaces, both of
which, for their type, are quite simply unsurpassably splendid.</p>
