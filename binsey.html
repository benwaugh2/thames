<h3>BINSEY</h3>

<p class="first">My old friend and tutor Gerda, despite having taught me
all I know about writing, seems to have little faith in me.</p>

<p>`It's about fifteen miles,' she insists of the route to Swinford.
I have worked it out painstakingly. Five miles, maximum. But I am a great
believer in fence sitting.</p>

<p>`Hmm,' I say, agreeably, `I would have thought about ten.'</p>

<p>`You won't be able to cycle much of the way,' she says. `It's not
a proper track. And it's very narrow.'</p>

<p>To which I point out that I have cycled everywhere up until now,
getting off to wait for pedestrians, and I can't see the Oxford riverside
meadow beating me. Anyway, I take up much less room on my bike than beside
it.</p>

<p>`There are hundreds of books on the Thames,' she says gloomily. `I
hope you've got a good angle.'</p>

<p>I sometimes wonder why I bother. But not for long. Gerda, bless
her, takes me on a detour to the tiny hamlet of Binsey. This was the home
of Miss Prickett (the Red Queen), governess to Alice Liddell, or Alice in
Wonderland. The churchyard is well peopled with Pricketts, resting in such
peace as is possible next door to the A34.</p>

<p>Binsey Church must be one of the few remaining unspoiled churches
in the country. The electric age has not touched it, as the simple hanging
oil lamps testify. It is part of the ancient priory of St Frideswide, a
Mercian princess (died 735) who founded a nunnery in Oxford. Regardless of
her decision to live a cloistered life, she was forced to flee the
attentions of the persistent King Algar. Whilst Frideswide lived secretly
and simply beside the Thames with a swineherd and his wife, Algar marched
on Oxford with his army and the town was saved from devastation only by
providence: Algar was suddenly struck blind, presumably as punishment.</p>

<p>The good Frideswide, though, felt sorry for Algar and prayed that
his sight should be restored. In answer to her supplications a holy well
sprang up (<i>can</i> a well spring up?)  and Algar was healed by its magical
water. St Frideswide built a church beside the well, which she dedicated
to St Margaret of Antioch.</p>

<p>She probably felt some affinity with Margaret, the daughter of a
pagan priest during the time of the Roman emperor Diocletian (245-313)
who ordered the last great persecution of the Christians. Margaret also
had to flee from the advances of an unwelcome suitor, the prefect Olybrius,
who then denounced her as a Christian. She went through various tortures
such as being swallowed by Satan in the guise of a dragon, and was finally
beheaded.</p>

<p>This is the original treacle well. Remember? In <i>Alice in
Wonderland</i> at the Mad Hatter's tea party the Dormouse (a.k.a. Charles
Dodgson, a.k.a. Lewis Carroll) tells the story of the three little girls who
lived at the bottom of the treacle well. In fact, this is truly a treacle
well. In ancient times treacle was the term for an antidote to poison and
a treacle well is thus a healing well.</p>

<p>When the Reverend Prout, one of Dodgson's friends, became the
incumbent of St Margaret's Church and lovingly restored it (which is why
it looks so perfect) he asked the author what he should do with the well.
Dodgson replied that, in his opinion, his friend should `Leave well
alone.' A man after my own heart. Consequently, St Margaret's well is as
it should be - uncovered with mesh and unlittered with explanatory signs.
Conservation at its best.</p>

<p>At the famous Trout Inn the barman insists that there is no local
ale. I hope none of the Morrell family hear him. We sit outside with a
raucous peacock for company, listening to the rushing weir and sheltered
from the rain by an overhanging ivy.</p>

<p>`Good luck with the book,' says Gerda as we part. `I'm sure it's
going to be really good.' She might have said so earlier.</p>
